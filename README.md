# adi_kann_guessing_game
## Project Problem Statement

The project is to develop a Guess the Number Game, a simple, interactive, and fun console-based application. The goal is to create an engaging user experience where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, receiving feedback and hints to improve their guesses

### Given objectives:
  - [x] Create a class named Console and move all the methods that retrieve and validate user input to that class. These methods can remain static. 
  - [x] Create a class named Game and move all the methods that display messages and handle user guesses to that class. Adjust these methods so they arenâ€™t static and use instance variables of the Game class to keep track of numbers, guesses, and so on.
  - [x] Update the application to use these classes and their methods. Make sure the application functions the same as it did before.
### Given guidelines:
  - [x] You should think of the user interfaces that are shown for the projects as starting points. If you can improve on them, especially to make them more user-friendly, by all means do so.
  - [x] You should think of the specifications that are given for the projects as starting points. If you have the time to enhance the applications by improving on the starting specifications, by all means do so.
### Implemented improvements:
  - Structure: code refactored to be modular and easier to maintain, with a clear separation between user input and game logic.
  - Performance: getIntWithinRange() method refactored to reduce redundant calls to getInt()
  - Added a feature to allow users to type "exit" to quit at any time, avoiding an infinite loop in case of repeated errors
  - Implementation of hints after each incorrect guess, such as whether the number is even/odd or a multiple of 5.
  - A detailed and colored summary of the game is displayed at the end of each round
  - Input validation, handling invalid data properly.
  
**The project aims to learn basic programming concepts: it helps practice and demonstrate core programming skills such as loops, conditionals and user input validation.**
